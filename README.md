# Java

This is a virtual file system i.e., when you run the program, you get a feel like you are working on the shell.
The Virtual file system was done as my Final Lab Test of the 4th Semester of my BCA Programming. Try running and get a feel of it.

It was run and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit. If you get any issues, let me know @geethadhavan@gmail.com
